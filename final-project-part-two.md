**Draft Visualizations**

I have developed several draft visualizations that anchor my storyboard. The socioeconomic comparison table shows that Cancer Alley has a much higher percentage of Black residents, lower income, and greater vulnerability compared to the state and national averages. The ArcGIS petrochemical facility map provides detail on specific plants, like Addis Carbon Black and BASF Geismar, and makes visible how these facilities cluster along the river. A second Cancer Alley distribution map uses color coding to highlight density across the parishes.

The next step will be to build a forecasting visualization for data centers that connects the lessons of Cancer Alley to present-day siting decisions. This will be paired with an overlay of demographic data, emphasizing inequities in exposure and health risks. The story will close with a policy-focused panel, where I translate the data into a clear set of recommendations for policymakers.

# User research 

## Target audience

This story is directed at policymakers who hold influence over land-use decisions that allow datacenters, refineries, and petrochemical facilities to be sited near urban neighborhoods, particularly the ones in Cancer Alley. These decisions have disproportionately impacted low-income, predominantly Black communities, concentrating environmental risks where residents already face structural inequities. Policymakers such as Senator Eddie Lambert, who chairs Louisiana’s Senate Environmental Quality Committee, and Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge have the power to change this trajectory. They can strengthen zoning and permitting standards, require robust environmental justice screenings, and invest in community-driven planning processes that safeguard public health. By shifting from reactive regulation to proactive prevention, leaders like Lambert and Broome can ensure that economic development does not come at the expense of the very communities most in need of protection.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Test clarity of the story and visualizations   | When you look at this chart/map, what message do you take away? or
Is the concept easy to understand, or is anything confusing?         |
| Identify the most relevant cancer outcomes to highlight.    |Which types of health impacts (e.g., lung cancer, reproductive cancers, asthma) feel most relevant to you in this context?
Do you think focusing on one cancer type is more powerful than showing overall cancer risk?                  |
|Getting emotional and policy resonance      |Does this visualization make the issue feel urgent?                  |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the data make sense to you at first glance? | Talked about grounding the work  | Said the story could stand out more if it compared future projections with past petrochemical impacts.            |Felt the visualization was impactful, but recommended adding more local data to ground the story.            |
| Which health outcomes feel most relevant?| Suggested focusing on cancers linked to air quality (lung, reproductive)|  Agreed with lung cancer, but also mentioned asthma and other respiratory issues.           |  Thought focusing only on cancer might be limiting, but still supported lung cancer as the main one           |
| Would this be useful for advocacy or policy? | Yes, if it shows what policymakers can actually do about it.| Said it could be powerful for public awareness campaigns.            |Said it could influence policy if I pair it with specific recommendations.             |

From my interviews, I learned that the story needs to be more focused and forward-looking. Multiple people said I should center the narrative on data centers as the main issue, while still connecting it back to Cancer Alley as an example of what happens when polluting facilities are allowed to cluster in vulnerable communities. Another big takeaway was the idea of adding a forecasting visualization that shows the potential health and environmental impacts of future data centers in urban areas. Interviewees felt this would make the story more urgent and relevant for policymakers.

# Identified changes for Part III
Based on my user interviews, I plan to adjust my project in several ways. The biggest change will be focusing more directly on data centers as the central story, while still drawing on Cancer Alley as a historical and comparative example. Interviewees also emphasized the importance of incorporating forecasting elements that highlight projected risks in urban areas, particularly if additional data centers are constructed. I will gather facility-level data (emissions, siting, demographic breakdowns) so the visualizations feel specific and grounded rather than general. Another change will be to improve clarity in the visualizations by adding labels, annotations, and clear takeaways that highlight what policymakers should pay attention to. While lung cancer will remain the primary health outcome, I will also explore including respiratory illnesses like asthma to capture the broader public health risks. Finally, I will close the story with concrete policy recommendations tied directly to the data, so that the visualizations don’t just inform but also point to clear actions.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Need to focus more clearly on data centers as the main story, while still tying in Cancer Alley as a historical example | Shift my visualizations to highlight forecasting around data centers, and use Cancer Alley as a comparison point instead of the main focus |
|Feedback asked for forecasting elements that show projected health/environmental impacts |Build out a projection chart that estimates cancer risk or pollution exposure if more data centers are built in certain areas |
| Some concern that focusing only on “cancer” might be limiting |Keep lung cancer as the primary health outcome, but consider adding respiratory outcomes like asthma to show broader impacts                                                                                 |
| Policy usefulness depends on clear recommendation    | End the story with a set of concrete options (zoning rules, buffer zones, stronger permitting, etc.) tied directly to the data                                                                                |

The interviews really helped me realize that my project needs to narrow its focus and feel more actionable. Instead of splitting attention equally between petrochemical facilities and Cancer Alley, I’ll make data centers the central case and use Cancer Alley as a supporting story that shows what happens when policymakers allow facilities to cluster in vulnerable areas. I’ll also shift from just showing static cancer risk data to building a forecasting visualization that projects future risks if siting practices don’t change. By adding facility-level examples, clearer annotations, and a final set of policy recommendations, I’ll ensure the story not only presents data but also directly points to what decision-makers can do differently.
